File Versions
====

:::{note}
Mountain Duck 4.12 or later required. Previously versions could be accessed from the [context menu](interface.md#context-menu-in-finder-and-windows-file-explorer) by right-clicking on a file in *Finder* on macOS or *File Explorer* on Windows and choosing *Versions*.
:::

A list of file versions can be viewed within the *Versions* tab of the *[Info](../cyberduck/info.md#versions)* window. The files can also be reverted to a chosen version of the list.

## Supported Protocols

The versions feature within the *Info* window is supported for the following protocols:

| **Protocol** | **Revert previous version** | **Open/Quick Look previous version** | **Delete version** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[S3](../protocols/s3/index.md)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **[Backblaze B2](../protocols/b2.md)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

:::{attention}
Using [S3](../protocols/s3/index.md) versions will only be displayed for buckets with versioning enabled. Versioning can be enabled per bucket in by choosing *Info → S3* in *Finder* on macOS or *File Explorer* on Windows. Alternatively, enable versioning in AWS Console or [Cyberduck](../cyberduck/index.md).

### Revert

You can revert to a previous version of a file by choosing *Versions → ... → Revert*. Wait for the *File Updated* notification which notifies the previous version has been restored.

### Delete

Permanently delete a previous version of the selected file.

### Preview 

This will open a *Quick Look preview* on macOS or open the previous version of the file in the default application on Windows.

## Custom versioning

Enable the custom versioning option in *Preferences → Versions* to store previous versions of a file for protocols without native versioning. The versions can be previewed, deleted or restored in *Info → Versions*.

Select you preferred handling in case of sync conflicts with earlier changes. Choose between *Rename existing* and *Overwrite*.

The versions are stored in a hidden folder named `.duckversions` in each folder on the mount. The versions are named like the following pattern: `filename.extension → filename-20230906102017.762.extension`

### Versions while transferring

Versioning for [overwriting](transfer.md#overwrite-prompt) existing files while uploading can be enabled by using a [hidden configuration option](preferences.md#hidden-configuration-options).

    versioning.enable=true

### Exclude files

To excluded files or file types from versioning use a [hidden configuration option](preferences.md#hidden-configuration-options).

    versioning.include.regex=.*

### Number of saved versions

Per default, the number of saved versions is limited to 5. The oldest version will be deleted once a new version is uploaded exceeding the limit.

The number of saved verions can be customized by using a [hidden configuration option](preferences.md#hidden-configuration-options).

    versioning.limit=5
